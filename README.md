# ðŸ”®  Wordle Wizard

***See possible next guesses in [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)***

**I'll be honest, I'm not very good at word games. Scrabble, Bananagrams, and now Wordle. They _are_ fun for me! To an extent. Because for some reason my brain just isn't good at coming up with words. I'm also not the quickest reader. I wonder if that's related. Anyway, to help get myself into Wordle, I did something my brain *does* find fun: coding!**

**What if I could make something that would make it easier for me to choose what word to try next? I could give it some parameters â€“ What letters do we KNOW are there? Which letters do we know aren't there? Would this be cheating? Who cares! Wordle is now wonderfully fun for me. Especially now that I get to take part in the post-game where my family and I tell each other what silly scene is being made in our coloured-emoji-square picture.**

## What's inside?

### `/browser`
This is the newer version of what's in `/node`. Instead of running a script in the terminal every time you wanted a new set of words, `/browser/index.html` provides a webpage interface for easy Wordle-ing.

[Click here](https://wordlewizard.vercel.app/) to view a live deployment of this webpage.

#### How to use this

If all you want to do is open this webpage on your computer, you can do so by downloading this repo and opening `/browser/index.html` in a web browser. However, if you want to mess around with the styles or scripts, there are a couple things you should know. 

The main webpage `index.html` is set up look for resources in `/browser/build/`, and you wouldn't want to work on those files directly. There are source files (in `browser/src/`) that should be much easier to make sense of, but, in their current state, would require pre-processing and bundling.

So you can either 
- Refactor those files to be vanilla CSS and non-importing JavaScript, and change `index.html` so it knows where to find them,
- Or have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, run `npm i` in the top-level directory, then, once you're done making your changes, run `npm run build` to make new output files in `/browser/build/`.

### `/node`
My first version of this Wizard was a simple script that I ran in the command line. It's not the most user-friendly â€“ you (1) had to know what the heck all this crap is, and (2) it's just kind of tedious to edit a script and run it for each guess.

#### How to use this
You'll need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, but once you do, you can run `node ./node/helper.js` in your command line and see what would be valid next guesses in Wordle.

Those next guesses are determined by what's in the first 4 lines:
```javascript
// ./node/helper.js
const knownPositions = ['', '', '', '', ''];
const existsButNotHere =  ['', '', '', '', ''];
const doesntExist = '';
const singlesOnly = true;
```
You'll need to fill in these variables according to the current state of your game and re-run the script file.

- `knownPositions` is an array of strings that should only be one lower case letter each.  
- `existsButNotHere` can handle multiple letters in the same position, but they all still need to be lowercase.  
- `doesntExist` is one long string of all the letters that aren't present in the solution. Again, lowercase.  
- `singlesOnly` is a boolean value of whether you want words with more the one of the same character in the output.  

### `/shared`

This is a folder that contains resources that are shared by both `/browser` and `/node`, namely:
- A list of accepted input words in Wordle
- A list of words that I know have already been done (so that they can be exlucded from the output list).
